## Telecom Churn Requirements


## Business Understanding: 
Problem Context: working at Proximus company and over 6 months, the company faces challenges, such as inflation, losses in customers, loss in revenue. The main issue explains the increase of customer's churn before 6 months time that causes high drop in company's performance. 

Purpose: my work as an ML Engineer is to build a model that classifies data based on churn 0 and 1 in order to use this insight to create
tasks to the model. That helps me to succeed in increasing company's performance over time. 

## Focus points for this project
1. Are customers leaving or staying at Proximus
2. Are some of the telecom details affect the churn of a customer? Which features?
